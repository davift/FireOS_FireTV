#> GCC flags help:
# -g:	 Produce debugging information
# -W:	 (-Wextra) This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall, inc. -Wunused-parameter.
# -O3:	 The compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time. Optimize yet more with -O3.
# -Wall: Turns on the warning flags
# -Wno-unused-but-set-variable:	Don't warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise unused (aside from its declaration).
# -Wno-array-bounds:		Don't warn whenever subscripts to arrays that are always out of bounds. This option is only active when -ftree-vrp is active (default for -O2 and above).
# -Idir:	 Add the directory dir to the head of the list of directories to be searched for header files. 
# -D name=definition: The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a ‘#define’ directive.
#
#> Unused:
# -c: Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.
# -s: Strip the debug information, so as to make the code as small as possible.
